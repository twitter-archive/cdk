Presentation software for engineers

[options="incremental"]

* Author slides in plain text (asciidoc)
* And play them in the browser.


== Simple Text markup

See

for examples of slides.

See
http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[the AsciiDoc cheatSheet]
for more examples of asciidoc markup.

x = list("Simeon")
def first_three_key(dct):
    return sorted(x.keys()[:3]
----    

== Line Number are Optional

[source,python,numbered]
----
# with line numbers

== I want presenter notes

Sorry. Working on it...

We do have "extra content". Put items in a sidebar directive and hit
"s". Try it now.


[[floating-bubble]]
**********
This is sidebar content.

Show it only if you need to...

== Of course you can make lists

And use a directive to make them appear one item at a time.

[options="incremental"]               
1. bulleted lists
2. ordered lists

== Easily done

Just learn graphviz so text like

.....................................................................
["graphviz"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph proxy {
  client -> proxy [ label = " request " ];
  proxy -> client [ label = " response " ];
  host -> proxy [ label = " response " ];
  proxy -> host [ label = " request " ]; 
} 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
.....................................................................

<<<

Ends up like

["graphviz"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph proxy {
  client -> proxy [ label = " request " ];
  proxy -> client [ label = " response " ];
  host -> proxy [ label = " response " ];
  proxy -> host [ label = " request " ]; 
} 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

== Keep Pulling

New features constantly landing!

== More Documentation

Coming soon...
